                Razorfish Health, a digital marketing agency of about 200
                employees focused on health, holds an all-hands agency event in
                the fall to come together and align on the direction of the

          <h2>The Business Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Razorfish Health was gearing up for the “Back to School” event at
            the Franklin Institute and needed to get the RFH team interested and
            generate some excitement around the event. Seeing this as an
            opportunity to also showcase some of our technological capabilities
            to our peers, it seemed like a perfect time to utilize some of our
            technical resources and explore new technology to roll out a fun and
            creative solution.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Some of the things we wanted to showcase were:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>The potential of Augmented Reality (AR):</strong>
              utilizing the emerging technology to create interactive and
              immersive experiences right on the phone
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How we are able to reach users:</strong> communication
              capabilities and strategies across digital channels
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The power of engagement:</strong> motivating active
              participation and excitement through interactive content that’s
              too compelling to ignore
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >The effectiveness of a different working methodology:</strong
              >
              specifically Lean and Extreme Programming (XP), to illustrate a
              more efficient and dynamic approach to the development process
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To make all this magic happen, we aimed to build an experimental
            mobile app that was designed to create a ton of buzz and flaunt our
            tech and engagement skills to our peers. We had a fairly ambitious
            timeline of about 3 months, and I was approached to lead the charge
            from conception to final product.

          <h2>My Approach:</h2>
          <p>To be successful in this endeavor, I employed these strategies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Move it along quickly:</strong> due to a tight timeline,
              initial rough conceptual thinking was socialized with leadership,
              approved, and we pressed forward
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Make it real, real fast:</strong> once we had our idea and
              the go-ahead, design ramped up quickly I began to create a shared
              prototype, with iterations happening rapidly
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Design for a high level of engagement:</strong> our
              solution had to be based around getting our users to get excited
              about the app and the event, and actually get involved!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Gamify the app:</strong> because we wanted our users to be
              highly motivated to actually use the app, we procured a budget for
              some pretty legit prizes so we could make it a competition
            </li>

              <strong
                >Work tightly with the developers and start building:</strong
              >
              using Axure RP, I produced a realistic prototype to be referenced
              by a team of developers dispersed over several locations around
              the country

            all-hands gathering

          <p>
            To generate excitement and build anticipation for the event, the app
            featured compelling design and engaging functionality, using visuals
            that were consistent with what attendees would experience at the
            offsite. To make participation easy, users could sign in with their
            corporate credentials, ensuring seamless access. The app encouraged
            user involvement through daily clues and tasks that required
            interaction with augmented reality (AR) elements and completion of
            short quizzes. Points were earned for regular app usage, fostering a
            sense of competition among participants. The app also maintained
            constant communication with users, prompting them to interact
            frequently. Additionally, it provided essential event information,
            such as directions and schedules, ensuring that users were
            well-prepared and engaged from start to finish.

            On the user’s initial sign-in, the app featured quick onboarding

            screens introduced the key gameplay concepts and provided an

            The dashboard needed to generate excitement, competitiveness, and
            just be fun!
          </h3>
          <p>
            The dashboard design needed to generate excitement, foster a sense
            of competitiveness, and be fun to use. To achieve this, we iterated
            on the design, exploring various options such as light and dark
            themes, and different layouts expressing various information
            hierarchies. We landed on a dark background concept that dedicated
            prime real estate to these key elements: a countdown to the event to
            build anticipation, a daily “clue” for tasks users needed to

            competition. A quick glance at the dashboard gave a user a view into
            the most important things they could do.

          <h3>We engaged our users in different ways</h3>
          <p>
            Our engagement strategy was multifaceted, blending AR interactions,
            gamification to ignite competition, and personalized communications
            tailored to individual user behavior. Daily tasks or clues were
            provided, encouraging regular interaction with the app, while push
            notifications reminded users to take their next steps to stay in the
            game.

              AR targets were discreetly hidden in the offices, with the app
              guiding users to find them through the daily clues. Upon
              discovering a target, users interacted with it and took a brief
              quiz, with their answers helping to categorize them based on their
              learning styles and aptitudes in areas such as finance, client
              management, innovation, and public speaking. These insights were
              then used to further customize in-person learning sessions.
              Additionally, personalized emails were sent at strategic
              intervals, fostering ongoing engagement and maintaining a strong
              connection with each user.

          <h3>Everything in the app was gamified to drive competitiveness</h3>
          <p>
            We integrated gamification wherever possible, fitting in as much as
            we could within the project’s scope. This meant that users could
            earn points for even the smallest of actions, like simply opening
            the app. While we didn’t explicitly inform users about these
            rewards, they quickly caught on and started racking up points. To
            further heighten the sense of competition, we offered extra bonuses
            to users who were the first to complete certain tasks each day or to
            reach an AR marker. This created a sense of urgency and encouraged
            users to stay ahead of the game. Additionally, we hid a few extra
            bonuses within the app, offering users a chance to discover and earn
            even more points. This added an element of surprise and kept users
            actively engaged with the app. The team had wanted to include a
            system of various badges for different achievements in the gameplay,
            but this idea was ultimately scrapped for scope concerns.

            Design was left intentionally simple for utility functions in the
            app
          </h3>
          <p>
            The app also needed to have basic event information such as
            directions to the venue, parking, schedule, etc.. There was a lot we
            could have done here to make these items more dynamic, but it would
            not have served our defined priorities. To be able to focus our
            efforts on the meatier stuff, these were designed to be built with
            minimal effort, and the result was very basic, but served the
            purpose.

          <h3>The app played a crucial role on event day</h3>
          <p>
            On event day, the app was used to guide participants through their
            schedule and room assignments, ensuring everyone was in the right
            place at the right time. During the breakout sessions, we leveraged
            the app’s capabilities by conducting a final exercise that
            highlighted its interactive features. Participants were asked to use
            the app again during innovation sessions, where they experienced a
            unique AR interaction based on their responses to questions
            throughout the week. This segmentation allowed us to tailor the AR
            experience, and, based on their quiz answers, we revealed each
            participant’s preferred learning style—auditory, visual, or tactile.
            This personalized approach not only showcased the app's versatility
            but also enhanced the overall user experience by aligning with
            individual learning preferences.

          <h2>Reflections & Learnings</h2>
          <h3>The power of gamification: key to app adoption</h3>
          <p>
            The gamification aspect of the app proved to be the most powerful
            engagement factor, driving its success and widespread adoption.
            While we didn't initially anticipate such high levels of
            competitiveness and desire to win, users quickly figured out how to
            maximize their points and eagerly exploited the game mechanics. In
            hindsight, adding more nuance to the points and scoring system could
            have made the experience even more compelling. Gamification is a
            powerful motivator, especially when rewards are at stake, and it was
            incredible to observe the excitement and competitiveness that buzzed
            through the office. Some users even went so far as to attempt
            various device hacks to edge out the competition!
          </p>
          <h3>While an overall success, the app did have some shortcomings</h3>
          <p>
            While the AR experience was visually impressive, it wasn’t engaging
            enough to hold users’ attention beyond earning points and completing
            quizzes. As well, despite the inevitable risks of bugs and glitches
            due to tight timelines, the team found creative solutions to address
            them, release quick patches, and keep the users invested in the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall the initiative was a big success, and a testament to the
            effectiveness of our team collaboration. The app generated lots of
            buzz and engagement, and the innovation session was well received.
