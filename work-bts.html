              <p>
                Razorfish Health was gearing up for the “Back to School” event
                at the Franklin Institute and needed to get the RFH team
                interested and generate some excitement around the event. Seeing
                this as an opportunity to also showcase some of our
                technological capabilities to our peers, it seemed like a
                perfect time to utilize some of our technical resources and
                explore new technology to roll out a fun and creative solution.
              </p>
              <p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>The potential of Augmented Reality (AR):</strong>

                  immersive experiences right on the phone

                <li>

                  capabilities and strategies across digital channels
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The power of engagement:</strong> motivating active
                  participation and excitement through interactive content
                  that’s too compelling to ignore

                To make all this magic happen, we aimed to build an experimental
                mobile app that was designed to create a ton of buzz and flaunt
                our tech and engagement skills to our peers. We had a fairly
                ambitious timeline of about 3 months, and I was approached to
                lead the charge from conception to final product.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Gamify the app:</strong> because we wanted our users
                  to be highly motivated to actually use the app, we procured a

                could sign in with their corporate credentials, ensuring

                were earned for regular app usage, fostering a sense of

                communication with users, prompting them to interact frequently.
                Additionally, it provided essential event information, such as
                directions and schedules, ensuring that users were well-prepared
                and engaged from start to finish.

                The dashboard design needed to generate excitement, foster a
                sense of competitiveness, and be fun to use. To achieve this, we
                iterated on the design, exploring various options such as light
                and dark themes, and different layouts expressing various
                information hierarchies. We landed on a dark background concept
                that dedicated prime real estate to these key elements: a
                countdown to the event to build anticipation, a daily “clue” for
                tasks users needed to complete, and prominently displayed points
                and status to encourage competition. A quick glance at the
                dashboard gave a user a view into the most important things they
                could do.

                behavior. Daily tasks or clues were provided, encouraging

                quiz, with their answers helping to categorize them based on
                learning styles and strengths across finance, client management,
                innovation, and public speaking. These insights then shaped
                in-person learning sessions, while personalized emails kept the

                Everything in the app was gamified to drive competitiveness
              </h3>
              <p>
                We integrated gamification wherever possible, fitting in as much
                as we could within the project’s scope. This meant that users
                could earn points for even the smallest of actions, like simply
                opening the app. While we didn’t explicitly inform users about
                these rewards, they quickly caught on and started racking up
                points. To further heighten the sense of competition, we offered
                extra bonuses to users who were the first to complete certain
                tasks each day or to reach an AR marker. This created a sense of
                urgency and encouraged users to stay ahead of the game.
                Additionally, we hid a few extra bonuses within the app,
                offering users a chance to discover and earn even more points.
                This added an element of surprise and kept users actively
                engaged with the app. The team had wanted to include a system of
                various badges for different achievements in the gameplay, but
                this idea was ultimately scrapped for scope concerns.

              </h3>
              <p>
                The app also needed to have basic event information such as
                directions to the venue, parking, schedule, etc.. There was a
                lot we could have done here to make these items more dynamic,
                but it would not have served our defined priorities. To be able
                to focus our efforts on the meatier stuff, these were designed
                to be built with minimal effort, and the result was very basic,
                but served the purpose.

              <h3>The app played a crucial role on event day</h3>
              <p>
                On event day, the app was used to guide participants through
                their schedule and room assignments, ensuring everyone was in
                the right place at the right time. During the breakout sessions,
                we leveraged the app’s capabilities by conducting a final
                exercise that highlighted its interactive features. Participants
                were asked to use the app again during innovation sessions,
                where they experienced a unique AR interaction based on their
                responses to questions throughout the week. This segmentation
                allowed us to tailor the AR experience, and, based on their quiz
                answers, we revealed each participant’s preferred learning
                style—auditory, visual, or tactile. This personalized approach
                not only showcased the app's versatility but also enhanced the
                overall user experience by aligning with individual learning
                preferences.

                Reflections & Learnings: Gamification works, but nuance matters
              </h2>
              <h3>The power of gamification: key to app adoption</h3>
              <p>
                The gamification aspect of the app proved to be the most
                powerful engagement factor, driving its success and widespread
                adoption. While we didn't initially anticipate such high levels
                of competitiveness and desire to win, users quickly figured out
                how to maximize their points and eagerly exploited the game
                mechanics. In hindsight, adding more nuance to the points and
                scoring system could have made the experience even more
                compelling. Gamification is a powerful motivator, especially
                when rewards are at stake, and it was incredible to observe the
                excitement and competitiveness that buzzed through the office.
                Some users even went so far as to attempt various device hacks
                to edge out the competition!
              </p>
              <h3>
                While an overall success, the app did have some shortcomings
              </h3>
              <p>
                While the AR experience was visually impressive, it wasn’t
                engaging enough to hold users’ attention beyond earning points
                and completing quizzes. As well, despite the inevitable risks of
                bugs and glitches due to tight timelines, the team found
                creative solutions to address them, release quick patches, and
                keep the users invested in the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall the initiative was a big success, and a testament to the
                effectiveness of our team collaboration. The app generated lots
                of buzz and engagement, and the innovation session was well
                received.
