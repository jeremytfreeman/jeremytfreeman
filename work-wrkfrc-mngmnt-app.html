          <h2 class="work-section">My Approach:</h2>
          <h3>Build trust with the team</h3>
          <p>
            As a new team member, I worked closely with stakeholders to build
            trust coming into the project, the client had already established a
            set of initial requirements and some rough design direction. This
            was a complex project with an aggressive timeline requiring me to
            quickly understand the ins and outs of the utility business and the
            business needs driving the requirements for the app. To build trust
            with my various stakeholders, I took every opportunity to
            collaborate very closely with them — meeting regularly, initiating
            ad hoc interviews, asking essential questions, and riding along in
            the field with the reps directly to gather data about their
            day-to-day working process and overall motivations, as well as
            frequently vetting my design work with them. Through my diligent
            approach to understanding the business needs, and listening to my
            stakeholders concerns, I quickly gained their trust, and became
            their go-to resource for helping them solve UX problems.

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h3>Gather insights</h3>
          <p>
            A formal research study for the project was not feasible due to time
            and resource constraints. However, I took a proactive approach by
            conducting ad-hoc research directly with the field service
            representatives (FSRs). Through ride-alongs, impromptu interviews,
            and informal feedback sessions, I gained valuable insights into
            their daily workflows, challenges, and preferences. These
            interactions provided a hands-on understanding of the reps’ needs
            and allowed me to tailor the design more effectively to their
            real-world tasks. This direct, iterative engagement ensured that the
            solution was grounded in the actual experiences of those who would
            use it most.
          </p>
          <h3>Streamline field work with smart, intuitive visual design</h3>
          <p>
            In considering the design for the app, my approach was driven by
            four core principles aimed at optimizing usability, leveraging AI,
            and presenting information in a way that reps could immediately
            understand and act upon.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, I focused on making the UI
            <strong>do as much work for the rep as possible</strong>. With the
            integration of AI, I sought to reduce some of the burden placed on
            the user by automating routine tasks and intelligently surfacing key
            information and choices. AI-powered suggestions and predictive
            functionalities were woven into the interface, offering reps actions
            and data tailored to their specific work orders, all while
            maintaining their control over final decisions. This allowed the
            system to act as a true assistant, minimizing repetitive actions and
            streamlining workflows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, I prioritized the
            <strong>visual representation of key real-world objects</strong>.
            Field reps deal with complex, tangible assets like meters, premises,
            and other equipment in their daily work. To enhance usability, I
            designed a visual language that reflected these real-world elements,
            ensuring that reps could immediately recognize and understand the
            tasks at hand. By bridging the gap between the digital interface and
            physical environment, the resulting UI was intuitive and familiar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thirdly, I aimed to create an interface that was as
            <strong> approachable as a consumer app </strong> without being
            overly embellished. This meant using design to express powerful
            functionality in elegant and simple ways, making the app easy to
            navigate and visually engaging without adding unnecessary
            complexity. Drawing inspiration from popular consumer applications
            and often social media-esque conventions, I focused on delivering a
            familiar and welcoming experience that empowered reps to accomplish
            their tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, the <strong>visual expression of data</strong> played a
            crucial role in my design approach. Given the vast amount of data
            becoming available to FSRs—from meter readings to customer
            history—it was important to present this information in a
            digestible, meaningful way allowing reps to grasp insights at a
            glance, make informed decisions quickly, and act on data-driven
            insights in the field.

        <section class="work-section">
          <h2 class="work-section">Solution:</h2>
          <h3>The dashboard was tailored to address the needs of the rep</h3>
          <p>
            Needing particular information available on the main app screen, the
            dashboard was designed to prioritize the rep's needs for a quick
            view of key information that was important to them. Seeing the
            nature of the work in the card view, work priority, visualizing the
            overall route for the day spatially, scheduling functionality,
            accepting work orders, and accessing work order information were
            key, and these items were given visual priority and were designed to
            be highly accessible from the dashboard. Other secondary and
            tertiary functions were tucked a tap or two away.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="images/work-wf-01.jpg"
              class="img-box-gray"
              width=""
              alt="FSR dashboard view"
            />
            <figcaption>

              schedule view
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h3>The design leveraged visual analogs to signify key objects</h3>
          <p>
            Wherever possible we implemented the strategy of using visual
            analogs to represent key real world items in the app. Visuals were
            created for tasks involving meters, premises, etc., enabling a
            visual connection and affordance to help make the app more
            intuitive. To make deeper use of this strategy, we developed ways of
            visually applying status indicators and actions using color and
            pictographic symbols where applicable. This visual approach reduced
            reliance on text, allowing FSRs to work faster and with greater
            accuracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the complexity use cases/edge cases increased, it was important
            that we make the experience as simple and intuitive as possible for
            the end user — leaning more on visual recognition and familiarity as
            opposed to simply text.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <h3>Work order cards were critical for rep decision making</h3>
          <p>
            The design of the work order cards played a pivotal role in enabling
            FSRs to efficiently manage their day, particularly when building
            their schedule. While AI assisted by partially assigning work
            orders, FSRs retained ultimate control over their schedule and
            needed at-a-glance insights to make informed decisions quickly and
            effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            FSRs needed a concise yet comprehensive overview of each work order
            to determine which tasks to prioritize. The cards were designed to
            convey essential information at a glance, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Job priority:</strong> Priority levels were prominently
              displayed to help FSRs determine which jobs required immediate
              attention.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Nature of the job:</strong> Clear icons and brief
              descriptions allowed FSRs to immediately understand the type of
              job, whether it was routine maintenance, repair, or an urgent
              service.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Meter size and status:</strong> Visual indicators conveyed
              the size of the meter and its operational status, ensuring FSRs
              could prepare accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Special requirements:</strong> Jobs that required
              additional resources, such as a two-man team, were highlighted
              with specific icons and symbols to ensure proper preparation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Premise services:</strong> Information on the services
              provided at the premise, such as electricity, gas, or water, was
              easily accessible on the card.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Special alerts:</strong> Notifications such as hazards or
              unique circumstances were made highly visible, reducing the chance
              of overlooking critical details.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Time window requirements: </strong>The cards included the
              required time window for each task, allowing for better scheduling
              and ensuring that FSRs met customer expectations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Location and travel time:</strong> To optimize route
              planning, travel time and distance were included on the card,
              helping FSRs make efficient scheduling decisions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Designing cards that contained all this information in a single,
            readable format was challenging. Early iterations struggled with
            overcrowded layouts, reducing readability and visual appeal.
            Additionally, piecemeal requests from the field team for new
            features complicated the design process.

          <p>
            Recognizing the need for a holistic solution, we dedicated a sprint
            cycle to rethinking the card design from the ground up. This process
            focused on prioritizing clarity, and improving the overall visual
            hierarchy, resulting in a cleaner, more organized layout. Textures
            and shapes were introduced to support accessibility for color-blind
            users, ensuring that all FSRs could easily interpret the
            information.
          </p>

          <h3>Addressing accessibility: designing for color blindness</h3>
          <p>
            Given the high prevalence of color blindness among the FSR
            workforce, the design of the cards had to be inclusive and
            accessible. Instead of relying solely on color-coded information, we
            introduced:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Textures and shapes:</strong> Different textures and
              geometric shapes were used to represent various job statuses,
              priority levels, and alerts. This allowed all users, regardless of
              color vision, to differentiate between important information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Clear iconography:</strong> The use of bold, easily
              distinguishable icons helped convey critical details without
              ambiguity.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The final design not only provided FSRs with the information they
            needed at a glance but also dramatically improved the efficiency and
            accuracy of their scheduling decisions. Feedback from the field team
            confirmed that the new card design was intuitive, reducing time
            spent on task organization and enhancing overall productivity.

          <h3>A guided process was designed for executing work orders</h3>

          <p>
            The app provided an end-to-end experience for the rep — better
            managing their schedule with the power of AI, starting a work order,
            turn by turn directions to the job site, logging activity, and
            completing a work order. Once starting a work order, a step by step
            process was initiated, guiding the rep through completion of the
            work order. Many edge cases had to be considered for different
            customer and situational scenarios. AI on the back end was driving
            the identification of needs for preventative maintenance and
            customer and revenue issues, resulting in the creation of work
            orders assigned through this app. The overall design strategy was to
            present AI-powered suggestions and recommendations while allowing
            for ultimate user control.
          </p>
          <figure>

              width=""
              alt="Finalize work order screen"
            />
            <figcaption>Work order finalization screen</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </section>
        <p>
          The app’s work order process was designed to streamline complex tasks
          while empowering field service representatives (FSRs) with intuitive,
          guided workflows. The premise view was a key element of this, offering
          an interactive map that displayed the location of meters and other
          essential assets at the location. This view not only made it easier
          for FSRs to navigate but also enabled them to actively contribute to
          data accuracy by uploading images or updating premise information in
          real time, reducing reliance on outdated data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meter view, we designed a visual analog that represented meters
          in a highly familiar way, giving the reps meter information and
          allowing FSRs to quickly capture data or perform meter-related tasks.
          This included seamless support for scenarios involving multiple or
          dual meters, and a streamlined process for adding or replacing meters.
          This design helped reps focus on the job at hand without getting
          bogged down by having to parse through monotonous prosaic interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The field activity section allowed reps to capture every action they
          performed in real time, creating a dynamic log and timeline that
          tracked progress across the work order. With the intergration of AI,
          the app could intelligently suggest actions based on the work order
          and specific location, speeding up repetitive data entry while
          ensuring the rep maintained full control. This smart assistance
          balanced efficiency with flexibility, enabling reps to override
          suggestions and make judgment calls as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the order was complete, the finalize view allowed FSRs to input
          final notes, flag work orders for back-office review, or even generate
          follow-up tasks. AI was used to mine these final notes for tribal
          knowledge collection, building a continuous loop of learning that
          could enhance future processes and train the learning models.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, after the work order was submitted, a feedback mechanism was
          provided for reps, where they could rate the work order, provide
          insights on the quality of information, and review key performance
          metrics like time efficiency and task accuracy. This feature
          encouraged transparency and continuous improvement, creating an
          invaluable feedback cycle between the field, the organization, and the
          system.
        </p>

        <h3>
          The design of the app connected users to more information than ever
        </h3>
        <p>
          An innovative aspect to the overall business transformation happening
          was an unprecedented connection of data throughout the organization.
          Within this app, the rep had access to data about the customer,
          assets, usage, premise history, and a variety of other relevant data
          from other apps and sources at their fingertips. These integrations
          provided access to information and capability the reps did not have
          prior. These data integrations necessitated a number of data
          visualization screens to be thought through and designed.

        </figure>

        <h3>Empowering reps with data access</h3>
        <p>
          By connecting various systems and centralizing data, the app allowed
          FSRs to work more efficiently and make informed decisions on the spot.
          Whether retrieving customer history, viewing service details, or
          accessing asset information, the app presented all this data at their
          fingertips, significantly enhancing their ability to resolve issues
          independently.
        </p>

        <p>Key data types made accessible to reps included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Customer data: Access to current and historical service information,
            previous work orders, and service requests helped FSRs better
            understand the context of each job.
          </li>
          <li>
            Asset information: Reps could quickly retrieve meter specifications,
            location, status, and maintenance history, enabling more accurate
            assessments in the field.
          </li>
          <li>
            Premise details: Information about the services provided at each
            location—such as electricity, gas, or water—was readily available to
            ensure reps had a complete overview of the job.
          </li>
        </ul>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Premise history timeline for deeper insights</h3>
        <p>
          To further empower FSRs, a premise history timeline was introduced,
          offering a chronological view of all activities related to a
          particular premise. This timeline displayed past work orders,
          maintenance tasks, service disruptions, and customer interactions in a
          visually digestible format. It provided a comprehensive picture of the
          premise’s history, helping FSRs understand recurring issues, previous
          fixes, and any long-term concerns with a given property.
        </p>
        <p>
          This timeline became an invaluable tool for troubleshooting, as reps
          could quickly identify patterns or past problems that might inform
          their current task. Whether they were addressing a persistent issue or
          confirming that past repairs were completed successfully, the timeline
          ensured that FSRs were fully equipped with historical context.
        </p>
        <h3>Data visualization for easy interpretation</h3>
        <p>
          With the large volume of data available, ensuring it was presented in
          a clear and digestible format was crucial. Instead of overwhelming
          users with raw data, the app employed thoughtful data visualization
          techniques to present complex information intuitively.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Visual hierarchies were established to prioritize key information,
            allowing reps to see the most critical data at a glance, such as job
            priority, meter status, and past service issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            Icons and color coding visually represented the status of tasks,
            alerts, and key metrics. Recognizing that many FSRs were colorblind,
            we expanded the design to include patterns and textures alongside
            color coding to convey important statuses without relying solely on
            color.
          </li>
          <li>
            Graphs and charts displayed usage history, work order timelines, and
            performance metrics, enabling reps to quickly spot trends or
            outliers in the data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interactive elements allowed FSRs to drill down into more detailed
            data when necessary, without cluttering the main interface.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Connecting data for seamless decision-making</h3>
        <p>
          By designing for both high-level overviews and deeper data
          exploration, the app allowed FSRs to navigate effortlessly between
          summary views and detailed insights. This flexibility was essential
          when dealing with urgent tasks or complex maintenance requests that
          required fast decision-making. The premise history timeline, combined
          with real-time data access and intuitive visualizations, empowered
          FSRs to be more self-sufficient, reducing dependency on office staff
          and improving their efficiency and accuracy in the field.
        </p>

        <section class="work-section">
          <h2>Future Work and Enhancements</h2>
          <p>
            Looking ahead, the app's capabilities can be further expanded
            through deeper AI integration and enhanced user interaction. A key
            opportunity lies in implementing natural language query capabilities
            paired with a generated analytics dashboard. This would allow field
            service reps (FSRs) to easily ask questions about their tasks or
            performance and instantly receive personalized, data-driven
            insights, empowering them to make more informed decisions with
            minimal effort. The integration of AI would also provide
            opportunities to streamline complex data analytics and allow users
            to interact more naturally with the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, introducing annotations for tribal knowledge will
            enable FSRs to document on-the-job learnings and best practices
            directly within the app. These annotations would help capture
            valuable institutional knowledge, facilitating better communication
            and knowledge sharing across teams. Expanding the use of the iPad’s
            camera for visual data capture would further enhance this process by
            allowing reps to upload images of completed work, site conditions,
            or equipment, enriching the data associated with each work order.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also significant potential in extending the app to other
            departments, tailoring the design to meet slightly different needs
            while maintaining a unified system. Incorporating personal analytics
            dashboards with elements of gamification could foster motivation by
            tracking individual performance metrics, providing incentives for
            completing tasks efficiently, and creating a more engaging user
            experience.
          </p>

        <section class="work-section">
          <h2>Reflections & Learnings</h2>
          <h3>Managing team dynamics throughout the project was critical</h3>
          <p>
            Over the course of 3 or so years, the project saw multiple
            iterations as deeper features were added and adjusted based on
            feedback from users in the field. Initially I was heavily hands-on,
            executing much of the design work myself, but as time went on I
            hired and directed other designers on the effort, often jumping in
            to work side by side with them in addition to managing other work.
            Throughout that time I remained the primary UX liaison and worked to
            ensure the strategy was delivered on, the work was of high quality,
            and that the team maintained the trust and confidence of our
            stakeholders.
          </p>
          <h3>There were missed opportunities</h3>
          <p>
            While the project delivered significant value, several areas
            presented opportunities for improvement. One notable limitation was
            that time constraints did not allow for much in the way of
            documentation. This lack of documentation made it more difficult to
            onboard new team members and ensure consistency throughout the
            project’s lifecycle. Having a more structured approach to
            documentation would have provided better clarity for the team and
            allowed smoother transitions as new members joined.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conducting more extensive user research earlier in the project could
            have provided deeper insights into the specific workflows and pain
            points of the FSRs, potentially resulting in more tailored design
            decisions from the outset. Although ad-hoc user research was
            conducted, a more formalized and iterative approach might have
            uncovered additional opportunities to optimize the app for
            real-world conditions.
          </p>

          <p>
            At minimum, sketch personas could have been developed earlier on to
            guide design decisions and onboard new team members more
            effectively. While user research was conducted, personas would have
            provided a clearer picture of the target users, helping align the
            team around user-centered goals and ensuring that design decisions
            remained focused on the needs of the field service reps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, more oversight over the final output from developers
            would have been beneficial. As the project progressed and timelines
            grew tight, ensuring closer alignment between the design and
            development teams could have mitigated issues such as minor
            inconsistencies in implementation. This would have helped maintain
            the original design vision and improved the quality of the final
            product.
          </p>

          <h3>A transformational implementation, intended to be productized</h3>
          <p>
            The advent of this app introduced a number of transformational
            capabilities to our utility client. The ability to schedule and
            predict working times allowed the organization to more accurately
            manage and conduct field operations with improved performance. With
            the collection and available access to data from across the
            organization, field reps were able to perform their jobs with more
            precision. Connections between data and mechanisms for collecting
            data positioned the organization to constantly improve and train
            their systems to be smarter.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the intention of this being a productized offering, this app
            became a proven template for a workforce management solution
            targeting water and energy sectors, among others.
