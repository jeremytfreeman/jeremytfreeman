            <p>
              As a part of an enterprise app suite for a utilities client, an
              app for supporting the tasks of hundreds of reps doing work in the
              field needed to be created. This initiative sought to replace an
              aged legacy Windows-based system.The legacy system was inefficient
              and clunky in field operations, with the outdated interface being
              archaic, and resulting in additional time tacked on to every field
              call to input data, often resulting in inaccuracies. Siloed
              systems gave Field Service Representatives (FSRs) limited access
              to critical customer data, resulting in less informed
              decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
              The new iPad app aimed to modernize workflows, implement smarter
              scheduling, and provide real-time access to essential
              data—enhancing data-capture accuracy, reducing call times, and
              achieving operational excellence, all within a few taps. Coming
              into the project, the client had already established a set of
              initial requirements and some rough design direction.

          <h3>Building trust with the team</h3>
          <p>
            As a new team member, I worked closely with stakeholders to build
            trust coming into the project, the client had already established a
            set of initial requirements and some rough design direction. This
            was a complex project with an aggressive timeline requiring me to
            quickly understand the ins and outs of the utility business and the
            business needs driving the requirements for the app. To build trust
            with my various stakeholders, I took every opportunity to
            collaborate very closely with them — meeting regularly, initiating
            ad hoc interviews, asking essential questions, and riding along in
            the field with the reps directly to gather data about their
            day-to-day working process and overall motivations, as well as
            frequently vetting my design work with them. Through my diligent
            approach to understanding the business needs, and listening to my
            stakeholders concerns, I quickly gained their trust, and became
            their go-to resource for helping them solve UX problems.

          <h3>
            Changing team dynamics over the course of the project needed to be
            managed
          </h3>
          <p>
            Over the course of 3 or so years, the project saw multiple
            iterations as deeper features were added and adjusted based on
            feedback from users in the field. Initially I was heavily hands-on,
            executing much of the design work myself, but as time went on I
            hired and directed other designers on the effort, often jumping in
            to work side by side with them in addition to managing other work.
            Throughout that time I remained the primary UX liaison and worked to
            ensure the strategy was delivered on, the work was of high quality,
            and that the team maintained the trust and confidence of our
            stakeholders.

            Needing particular information available on the main app screen, the

            nature of the work in the card view, work priority, visualizing the
            overall route for the day spatially, scheduling functionality,
            accepting work orders, and accessing work order information were
            key, and these items were given visual priority and were designed to
            be highly accessible from the dashboard.

            The design of the app connected users to more information than ever
          </h3>
          <p>
            An innovative aspect to the overall business transformation
            happening was an unprecedented connection of data throughout the
            organization. Within this app, the rep had access to data about the
            customer, assets, usage, premise history, and a variety of other
            relevant data from other apps and sources at their fingertips. These
            integrations provided access to information and capability the reps
            did not have prior. These data integrations necessitated a number of
            data visualization screens to be thought through and designed.

          <h3>
            A design strategy of representing real world objects visually in the
            app
          </h3>
          <p>
            Wherever possible we implemented the strategy of using visual
            analogs to represent real world items in the app. Visuals were
            created for tasks involving meters, premises, etc., enabling a
            visual connection and affordance to help make the app more
            intuitive. To make deeper use of this strategy, we developed ways of
            visually applying status indicators and actions using color and
            pictographic symbols where applicable.

          <p>
            As the complexity use cases/edge cases increased, it was important
            that we make the experience as simple and intuitive as possible for
            the end user — leaning more on visual recognition and familiarity as
            opposed to simply text.

          <h3>A guided process was designed for executing work orders</h3>

          <p>
            The app provided an end-to-end experience for the rep — better
            managing their schedule with the power of AI, starting a work order,
            turn by turn directions to the job site, logging activity, and
            completing a work order. Once starting a work order, a step by step
            process was initiated, guiding the rep through completion of the
            work order. Many edge cases had to be considered for different
            customer and situational scenarios. AI on the back end was driving
            the identification of needs for preventative maintenance and
            customer and revenue issues, resulting in the creation of work
            orders assigned through this app. The overall design strategy was to
            present AI-powered suggestions and recommendations while allowing
            for ultimate user control.

          <h2>Reflections & Learnings</h2>
          <h3>A transformational implementation, intended to be productized</h3>
          <p>
            The advent of this app introduced a number of transformational
            capabilities to our utility client. The ability to schedule and
            predict working times allowed the organization to more accurately
            manage and conduct field operations with improved performance. With
            the collection and available access to data from across the
            organization, field reps were able to perform their jobs with more
            precision. Connections between data and mechanisms for collecting
            data positioned the organization to constantly improve and train
            their systems to be smarter.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the intention of this being a productized offering, this app
            became a proven template for a workforce management solution
            targeting water and energy sectors, among others.
