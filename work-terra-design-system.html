                        <p>In building an experience team for a nascent startup building an AI-based platform for
                            enterprise
                            apps, I faced a variety of challenges. Among the challenges: a lack of UX standards and
                            consistent application, issues with iteration speed and progress, development hand-off
                            issues —
                            all resulting in high costs and inefficiency for development downstream. The solutions
                            implementation team was struggling with these inefficiencies as the company grew, leading to
                            significant challenges in maintaining consistent design across various products. The lack of
                            a
                            centralized system for UX patterns resulted in duplicated efforts and wasted time, as
                            designers
                            repeatedly created similar components without a unified approach. As well, platform clients
                            were
                            designing their own patterns without guidelines, contributing more chaos and redundancy. A
                            lack
                            of governance not only increased workload but also led to a disjointed user experience,
                            where
                            similar functionalities were expressed differently across various solutions, causing
                            confusion
                            for users and diminishing the overall effectiveness of the final products.</p>

                    rapidly designing and deploying AI-powered enterprise apps. In creating a common design language, we
                    would be able to speed up the design process, increase re-usability, and reduce design and
                    development
                    costs, while delivering a more consistent and usable product.</p>

                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                <h3>As a foundational source of truth, we documented basic and flexible UI standards</h3>
                <p>Basic UI elements and general usage guidelines were defined to ensure executional consistency. The
                    system
                    was created as intentionally basic and flexible - to be skinned and re-imagined for different client
                    branding and style needs.</p>

                <h3>Create efficiency and cost savings downstream with reusability</h3>
                <p>A library of common reusable components and repeatable patterns used in our solutions were documented
                    —
                    ranging from simple functionality to advanced multi-part components. With this, we were able to
                    expedite
                    the design process, efficiently reuse components, and effect cost savings downstream.</p>

                </figure>

                <h3>The platform required unique UI patterns for capturing tribal knowledge</h3>
                <p>A core feature of the app platform was to provide provisions for users creating annotations to
                    collect
                    and activate institutional employee (tribal) knowledge. This data is used to improve and train
                    machine
                    learning models, and provide more accurate correlative and predictive capabilities. This presented a
                    unique and ambiguous challenge in anticipating how and when this might theoretically be used, and
                    what
                    types of information needed to be expressed.</p>

                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Ideation sketches for tribal knowledge collection and feedback loop</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Expeditious techniques and processes were adopted for rapid ideation and exploration</h3>
                <p>For the unique tribal knowledge capture functionality, rough sketches with a digital drawing tool
                    were
                    used for early explorations and for providing initial creative direction. I was able to quickly
                    flesh
                    out ideas and validate them with leadership early, before executing high fidelity design. At times,
                    these sketches were even used to produce rough interactive prototypes. These techniques continued to
                    be
                    used on a regular basis in working with stakeholders for solution implementations.</p>

                </figure>

                <h3>Inspiration was drawn from social media type mechanisms to create an intuitive familiarity </h3>
                <p>Annotations were intended to be applied to any element type in our solutions, so many potential use
                    cases had to be considered. Basic text annotations seemed to be a natural starting point, and so we
                    brainstormed on how a user might intuitively express meaning in various ways — exploring text input,
                    entity tagging, correlations, context, data issues, sentiments, etc. Striving to let the user
                    provide information in a simple and familiar way, I drew a lot of inspiration from social media type
                    interactions.</p>

                </figure>
                <h3>Annotation patterns were designed to be flexible, extendable, and scalable to various more complex
                    interface element types</h3>
                <p>In addition to textual information, annotating other information types such as tabular, temporal,
                    and
                    spatial information needed to be considered, with an eye toward a future of annotating more dynamic
                    information such as video and image sequences.</p>

                    and UI developers, we were able to solve design problems in fewer cycles, and expedite efforts
