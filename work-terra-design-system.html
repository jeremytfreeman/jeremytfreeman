                  Rapidly scaling, AI-focused enterprise apps were shipping

                When inconsistency becomes costly: The slow bleed of design and

              </h2>
              <p>
                In building an experience team for a nascent startup building an
                AI-based platform for enterprise apps, I faced a variety of
                challenges. Among the challenges: a lack of UX standards and
                consistent application, issues with iteration speed and
                progress, development hand-off issues — all resulting in high
                costs and inefficiency for development downstream. The solutions
                implementation team was struggling with these inefficiencies as
                the company grew, leading to significant challenges in
                maintaining consistent design across various products. The lack
                of a centralized system for UX patterns resulted in duplicated
                efforts and wasted time, as designers repeatedly created similar
                components without a unified approach. As well, platform clients
                were designing their own patterns without guidelines,
                contributing more chaos and redundancy. A lack of governance not
                only increased workload but also led to a disjointed user
                experience, where similar functionalities were expressed
                differently across various solutions, causing confusion for
                users and diminishing the overall effectiveness of the final
                products.

                My approach: shaping a system built for today—and what was yet
                to come
              </h2>
              <p>
                I set out with some strategies to facilitate a shift in how the
                experience worked and delivered design to the organization. By
                establishing a unified design language, and taking a different
                approach to our work, the team would be able to streamline the
                design process, improve reusability, and reduce costs while
                ensuring consistency and scalability across the platform. The
                focus would be on creating a system that could rapidly meet the
                unique demands of the types of enterprise applications we were
                working on, and being able to adapt to evolving scenarios in the
                future.
              </p>
              <p>To achieve this, we planned to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Align our teams:</strong> Bring UX and development
                  teams together around a shared design language and set of
                  principles to guide decision-making and collaboration.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Design for scale:</strong> Develop a component-based
                  design system that breaks down complex UI patterns into
                  standard reusable elements, such as cards, buttons, forms,
                  grids, and typography, ensuring modularity and consistency.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Prioritize enterprise situations: </strong>Curate
                  reusable patterns tailored to enterprise scenarios, such as
                  managing large datasets, tabular information, pagination, and
                  AI-driven search capabilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Create guidelines and standards:</strong> Establish a
                  comprehensive style guide and pattern library to clearly
                  communicate the system’s rules and standards to all
                  stakeholders, including designers, developers, and product
                  managers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Plan for functional and platform flexibility:</strong>
                  Ensure the system was adaptive enough to be implemented across
                  various platforms (mobile, web, and iPad) and versatile enough
                  to accommodate different client needs as they emerged.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Have it ready quickly:</strong> given the frantic pace
                  of ongoing projects and the genesis of new ones, we needed to
                  very quickly have some standard in place and continuously
                  build on it. Like a spoken language, we needed to use it now,
                  but understand that it would always be changing.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Looking ahead, we also identified critical areas to focus on:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Governance and maintenance:</strong> Implement version
                  control and create robust documentation to make the system
                  easy to adopt and scale. Regular review sessions and curated
                  additions to the system would prevent redundant or conflicting
                  designs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Collaboration and ownership:</strong> Foster a
                  collaborative environment where multiple designers could
                  contribute to the system, with clear ownership and
                  responsibilities. This included regular feedback cycles and
                  frequent communication to ensure we weren’t wasting time with
                  duplicate efforts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >Future-proofing: (or at least future-anticipating)</strong
                  >
                  We would need to anticipate undefined or abstract use cases,
                  ideating patterns that could evolve with the platform’s needs.
                  While designing for the uncharted realm of AI, there weren’t
                  exactly comparable references elsewhere to look at, we had to
                  imagine how our product might be used in innovative ways and
                  push the limits of our thinking.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These strategies would enable us to navigate the challenges of
                rapid platform growth, support diverse enterprise needs, and
                build a design language that is both practical and
                forward-thinking.

                A core feature of the app platform was to provide provisions for
                users creating annotations to collect and activate institutional
                employee (tribal) knowledge. This data is used to improve and
                train machine learning models, and provide more accurate
                correlative and predictive capabilities. This presented a unique
                and ambiguous challenge in anticipating how and when this might
                theoretically be used, and what types of information needed to
                be expressed.

                able to quickly flesh out ideas and validate them with
                leadership early, before executing high fidelity design. At
                times, these sketches were even used to produce rough
                interactive prototypes. These techniques continued to be used on
                a regular basis in working with stakeholders for solution
                implementations.

                Annotations were intended to be applied to any element type in

                Basic text annotations seemed to be a natural starting point,

                let the user provide information in a simple and familiar way, I
                drew a lot of inspiration from social media type interactions.

                In addition to textual information, annotating other information
                types such as tabular, temporal, and spatial information needed
                to be considered, with an eye toward a future of annotating more
                dynamic information such as video and image sequences.

                Instituting a design system smoothed out UI dev operations
              </h3>
              <p>
                By creating a library of high-quality patterns and guidelines,
                and a source of truth for our designers and UI developers, we
                were able to solve design problems in fewer cycles, and expedite
                efforts downstream by working more efficiently and consistently.
                The result being a more unified product experience for our end
                users.
