              As leader in user experience with a history of over two decades, I
              specialize in guiding teams to craft digital products that
              redefine and activate business strategies. I practice a
              user-centered design method guided by curiosity and empathy that
              revolves around not just delivering a solution, but a dynamic
              experience with an eye towards the aesthetic. Having filled many
              different roles across the front end spectrum, I am able to
              consider and approach a problem through the lenses of various
              disciplines. My leadership style is characterized by an ability to
              understand and build trust with the teams I work with, enabling me
              to guide stakeholders through a fully collaborative process.
              Employing hands-on direction and tight communication, I take great
              satisfaction in working to choreograph initiatives to successful
              outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              My passion for design has deep roots, stemming from childhood when
              I found joy in both the creative and the analytical. I loved
              science, art, and drawing, often spending hours drawing animals,
              assembling models, and gazing over anatomy books. This fascination
              naturally evolved into design, where I could blend logic and
              organization with creativity. Over time, my interests converged in
              the world of UX, where the complexity, science and art of the
              human being intersects with the languages of design and code in
              creating products and experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
              I brand myself as a full-stack UX designer because of the diverse
              skills I’ve cultivated throughout my career. From user research to
              front-end development , I’ve embraced every facet of the design
              and front-end build process. Starting my career as a designer, it
              was fairly commonplace to be responsible for designing interfaces
              as well as building all of the html before handing off to the
              development teams, and so I became very adept at producing html in
              the early days. As well, we were working with other technologies,
              doing things like coding cd-rom apps using Lingo in Director, and
              ActionScript in Flash.
            </p>

            <p>
              As my career progressed, the roles I took on became more
              specialized. I’ve functioned as a designer for various product
              companies, worked in corporate institutions within the tech team,
              and as a consultant in agency environments. Eventually my career
              leading me to more pure UX roles where I was more focused on the
              leading discovery and research initiatives, producing high level
              design to be consumed by the UI designers who produced the final
              UI. In more recent roles, those UX and UI design roles have again
              converged, reigniting my interest in hands-on UI design, and as of
              late, I am seeking to return to my full-stack foundations in some
              capacity or another, enjoying the challenges that coding presents.
              My belief is that UX, design, and development roles are very
              closely intertwined, working to solve a common problem on
              different levels, and that for the best outcome these disciplines
              must be aligned, and work very closely. By maintaining my unique
              skill set, if I myself am not doing all the work — I can at the
              very least effectively communicate, empathize with, and build
              trust with my peers to better collaborate on the problem. I take a
              lot of pride, and see a lot of value in having this broad skill
              set.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thoughtful leadership and teamwork are central to my approach. I
              believe that the key to successful product teams lies in clear
              communication, empathy, and collaboration with all the
              stakeholders involved. My approach to leadership emphasizes
              humility, active listening, building trust, accountability, and
              the ability to see things from perspectives other than my own. I
              find deep satisfaction in blending ideas and working alongside
              others to create something much greater than the sum of its parts.
            </p>

            <p>
              Outside of my career, the spirit of curiosity and problem solving
              continues, I enjoy underwater exploring of tropical seas, and I am
              a certified scuba divemaster and instructor. I like to frequent my
              home gym, and train Thai boxing. I love working with my hands —
              experimenting with woodworking and home improvement projects,
              creating a home for my family.
